# Retail Sales ETL Pipeline (Stage 1)

## Business Problem

A retail company receives daily sales data in CSV format.
The data contains customer, product, and transaction information in a single flat file.

The objective is to:

- Clean and transform the data
- Design a star schema data model
- Load structured data into SQL Server
- Enable analytical reporting using Power BI
- Implement logging and incremental load logic

This project simulates a production-grade ETL pipeline.
